### Team: Manell

## Concept Note

It's about time that we treat home-based business, like 'real operational business models'! Marketing and innovation are indispensable barriers to a successful and lucrative business. Manell is the answer for small businesses that are unable to reach their desired market. It leverages the sellers to focus on the distribution and marketing of their products and instead diverts them to serve the best of their products to clients. It aids home-based businesses to reach their full entrepreneurial potential, alongside filling the gap where clients don't get a personalized experience for the items they really want. Shipping and delivery strategies will be taken care by Manell to ease the customers, as the end-to-end tracking elevates transparency and trust.
Manell will be more than just an e-commerce platform which connects home based businesses sellers with their clients.

## Current Problems That We See

- No platform for talented home entrepreneurs of Pakistan, specially women.
- No specific platform for users to find their desired customized products. It's all over the place on social media platforms.
- Less reliable to order through social media pages as admins put down negative reviews inorder to maintain a false good image infront of new visitors.
- Marketing and maitaining the social media inorder to get followers and engaging customers by posting regularly.
- No way to monitor business trends of creative and homebased market.
- Talent wastage due to lack of resources.
- No proper access to delivery and payment methods available.
- When it's about scaling up the business it's difficult to manage orders through instagram and facebook chats. And, most people can't afford or find it difficult to develop their own e-shop.

Also,
Many home based business owners are unaware about their entrepreneurial personality type and limitations. This restricts them to manage their resources and work on their areas of weakness. For example, if an individual is great at sales but less experienced with bookkeeping, he should instead focus on sales and hire someone else to handle the books. But in many of the cases home based businesses lack this support. This is where Manell comes to play its part!

## Solution

Magics in businesses do not happen overnight! Manell's aim is to standby the onboarded businesses and to manage their workflow as they scale through all struggles. Furthermore, keeping the customers delighted is an extended goal, since a satisfied customer base keeps the business going. Many of the time home-based business overlooks this factor and misses upon greater opportunities.

- Remove founder dependence in the long run- (Via Trust).
- Effective Marketing (Social Media+Search Engine Visibility+App).

## Possible Future Opportunities
